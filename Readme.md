# art-module template

Use this template to quickstart your art-module development.

Take a look at the [art-framework documentation](https://art-framework.io/#/developer/modules) for more details.

## Template Setup

* Create a new Github project using this template.
* Clone the new repository and open it in IntelliJ.
* Update the gradle.properties file and change the following variables:
    * group: your-maven-group-id (e.g.: io.github.silthus)
* Update the root.projectName inside settings.gradle. This will be your artifactId.
* Delete the CHANGELOG.md. It will be generated on your first release.
* Rename the java package and module to match your project.
* Code away :) - and once you are ready, push your commit (in conventional commit style) to master.
