This [art-framework](https://art-framework.io) module provides easy replacements for all placeholders of the [PlaceholderAPI](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI/) in your art-configurations.

Here is the exact example from the [PlaceholderAPI documentation](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI/wiki/Hook-into-PlaceholderAPI#setting-placeholders-in-your-plugin) implemented in the art-framework.

The following art-script will broadcast the given message when a player joins the server and replaces the placeholders.

```yaml
art:
  - '@player.join'
  - '!broadcast "%player_name% &ajoined the server! They are rank &f%vault_rank%"'
```
